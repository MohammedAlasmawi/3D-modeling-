# Blender 3D Projects


I created two 3D modeling projects using Blender: a 3D Office Model and a Headset Model. The office model showcases a detailed workspace with desks, chairs, and other essential elements, focusing on realistic proportions and textures. The headset model highlights intricate design aspects, including ear cushions, headband structure, and material finishes. These projects allowed me to explore Blender's modeling, texturing, and rendering capabilities while refining my skills in creating detailed and visually appealing 3D assets.
